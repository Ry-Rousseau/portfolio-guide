# üó∫Ô∏è Ryan's Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! Here I document my projects in data analysis, machine learning, visualization and end-to-end research.

Every project uses real-world data that I gathered, pre-processed and merged into final datasets. Most projects involve all aspects of data science, but they are grouped based on their primary focus. 

I'm particularly proud of my MSc Dissertation and Authoritarian Banking Crises paper, which demonstrate novel research in social science using advanced data science techniques.

### Machine Learning
| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚ùé [Uber Taxi](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Uber%20Project) | May 2023 | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processinsg NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
| üê∂ [Dog Adoption](https://github.com/katiehuangx/data-engineering/tree/main/Dog%20Adoption) | Mar 2023 |Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
