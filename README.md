# üó∫Ô∏è Ryan's Portfolio

Welcome to my data portfolio! Here I document my projects in data analysis, machine learning, visualization and end-to-end research.

Every project uses real-world data that I gathered, pre-processed and merged into final datasets. Projects are grouped based on their primary focus in data science. Featured projects include projects I'm particularly proud of, which provide new contributions in my areas of research.

### Featured Projects
| Project Link | Completion Date | Project Description | Methods/Tools | 
|---|---|---|---|
|üì≤ [MSc Dissertation: Modeling Online Social Networks for Collective Action](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/msc_dissertation-relational-event-modeling/blob/main/README.md) | September 2024 | Developed and implemented an end-to-end pipeline for modelling large-N social media interactions with an original network analysis model. Finds that while activity and popularity drive online movements, underlying social formations are highly temporary, questioning the social cohension of successful internet-based collective actions. | Python (pandas), R (survival, tidyverse, ggplot2), LaTeX, eventnet|
|üíµ [Autocratic Bank Bailouts: Financialized Pensions Research](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/academic-research/blob/main/bjps_non_dem_banking_crises/README.md) | Jan 2025 | Analyzes how financialized pension schemes contrain autocratic regimes during banking crises. Develops a comprehensive dataset with advanced data engineering techniques. Demonstrates that autocratic governments with pensions schemes provide significantly more extensive bailouts to protect accumulated wealth and maintain critical political support networks. | Python, R (rMIDAS, tidyverse), Deep Learning, Data Engineering, LaTeX |
|üßë‚Äçüíª [AI Daily Briefer (Project Janice)](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/morning-brief) | Ongoing | AI-powered morning briefing system that aggregates personalized data from Gmail, Calendar, Weather, and News APIs through a multi-tiered LLM pipeline, automatically generating conversational audio summaries using Google's Gemini AI and Cloud Text-to-Speech services. Follows professional Python development standards with modular design and proper package structure. Open to collaboration. | Google Cloud, Python (Pandas), APIs, OAuth authentication, SSH Remote Hosting (Ollama)|

### Data Analysis and Visualization
| Project Link | Completion Date | Project Description | Methods/Tools |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üëÆ [UK Police Stop and Search](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/data-analysis-exploration/uk-police-stop-search-investigation/Stop-Search-Report.html) | Jan 2024 | A visual analysis of bias in stop and search rates amongst UK police, extracting data from APIs, storing in relational database, drawing conclusions from visual evidence | R (ggplot2, tidyverse), GeoJSON, APIs, SQL, Relational Database |   
| üè´ [Primary School Network Analysis](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/blob/main/data-analysis-exploration/education-network-analysis/education_network_analysis.html) | April 2024| An analysis of 6th-8th grade social networks based on measured indicators of social interaction, creating visualizations, feature engineering, extracting inter-personal dynamics for social insight | R (igraph, tidyverse, ggplot2), RMarkdown| 
| üßÆ [Economic Policy Interventions Survey Analysis](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/academic-research/tree/main/ejpr_econ_preferences) | April 2025 | Conjoint survey experiment conducted in Australia and the United Kingdom in early 2021 to examine public support for COVID-19 economic interventions, comparing preferences between wage subsidies and financial stabilization measures. Utilizes extensive visualization, causal inference, social modeling to find trends in intervention support. | R (tidyverse, renv, cregg), LaTeX|

### Machine Learning
| Project Link | Completion Date | Project Description | Methods/Tools |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üéØ [Voter Turnout Prediction Pipeline](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/tree/main/machine-learning/gb-forest-voter-predictor) | April 2024 | Developed and implemented advanced ensemble methods for binary classification, predicting voter turnout based on election study data, identifying non-voters on polling day with a 64.56% accuracy. The pipeline encompassed transforming raw data, selecting features via variable importance, handling class imbalance, booststrapping aggregated trees, and developing a LightGBM ensemble model with cross-validation, bayesian optimization.| R (LightGBM, randomForest, glmnet, tidyverse, missForest)|
| üåç [Civil War Predictor](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/tree/main/machine-learning/ml-civil-war-classifier) | February 2024 | Designed a custom data model for predicting civil war from historical country-year dataset. Utilizes LASSO logistic regression with feature selection, with cross validation and grid search for hyperparameter optimization. | R (tidyverse, glmnet) |

### Deep Learning
| Project Link | Completion Date | Project Description | Methods/Tools |    
|---|---|---|---|
| üìà [Stock Price Predictor (LSTM Neural Network)](https://github.com/Ry-Rousseau/ds-portfolio/tree/main/deep-learning/LSTM-net-stock-predictor) | January 2024 | Develops a neural network for predicting short-term changes in stock price for technology-based ticker symbols. Uses grid search for hyperparameter optimization and adapts to time-series analysis via long short-term memory network design. Achieves accuracy in predicting direction of future 10-minute price movement in 61% of minutes in test data. | Python (Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), LaTeX |
